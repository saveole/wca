# Feature Specification: UI Testing Workflow for AI Coding Tools

**Feature Branch**: `[002-add-ui-testing]`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add UI testing workflow for AI coding tool like Claude Code to test or fix UI issues"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with AI coding tools, I need a comprehensive UI testing workflow so that I can validate UI changes, verify visual regressions don't occur, and ensure that AI-assisted fixes don't break existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am working on a UI component, **When** I make changes to the component, **Then** the system MUST run visual regression tests to compare screenshots before and after changes
2. **Given** I am implementing accessibility improvements, **When** I run accessibility tests, **Then** the system MUST validate WCAG compliance and report any violations
3. **Given** I am testing interactive components, **When** I simulate user interactions, **Then** the system MUST verify button states, form validation, and loading indicators work correctly
4. **Given** I am using an AI coding tool, **When** the tool makes UI changes, **Then** the system MUST provide clear test results that the AI can understand and use to fix issues

### Edge Cases
- Cross-browser compatibility testing MUST focus on Chrome only (since this is a Chrome extension)
- How are false positives in visual regression testing handled?
- Visual regression tests MUST include manual approval workflow for intentional changes

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide visual regression testing capabilities that compare screenshots across different UI states
- **FR-002**: System MUST support automated accessibility testing with WCAG 2.1 Level AA validation
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable interactive component testing for user interactions including button states, form validation, and loading indicators
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide test commands that AI coding tools can execute to validate UI changes
- **FR-005**: System MUST support theme testing (dark/light mode) to ensure consistent appearance across themes
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate responsive design across desktop viewport sizes
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate clear test reports that AI tools can interpret to understand and fix issues
- **FR-008**: System MUST support testing of Chrome extension popup UI interactions and settings page functionality

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Test Suite**: A collection of UI tests organized by type (visual, accessibility, interaction)
- **Test Result**: The outcome of a test execution including pass/fail status and actionable feedback
- **Visual Baseline**: Reference screenshots used for comparison in visual regression testing
- **Accessibility Report**: Detailed findings from WCAG compliance checks
- **Component Test**: Individual test cases targeting specific UI components and their interactions

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What specific WCAG compliance level should the accessibility testing target? ‚Üí A: WCAG 2.1 Level AA (standard for most web applications)
- Q: What is the target success rate for AI tool interpretation of test results? ‚Üí A: 80% success rate (AI can understand and fix 80% of issues)
- Q: What types of viewports should be included in responsive design testing? ‚Üí A: just desktop
- Q: How should intentional improvements that trigger visual regression test failures be handled? ‚Üí A: Manual approval workflow for intentional changes
- Q: What browsers should be included in cross-browser compatibility testing? ‚Üí A: Chrome only (since this is a Chrome extension)
