2. Click "+ New integration"
3. Configure integration:
   - Name: "WebClip Assistant Test"
   - Associated workspace: Select your workspace
   - Capabilities: "Read content", "Insert content"
4. Copy "Internal Integration Token" (starts with `secret_`)
5. Save integration

### 2. Create Test Database
1. In Notion, create a new database or use existing one
2. Ensure database has these properties:
   - **Name** (Title property, required)
   - **URL** (URL property)
   - **Description** (Rich text property)
   - **Summary** (Rich text property)
   - **Notes** (Rich text property)
   - **Tags** (Multi-select property)
   - **Created Date** (Date property)
3. Share database with your integration:
   - Click "Share" → "Invite"
   - Select your integration name
   - Give "Can edit" access

### 3. Configure Extension
1. Open WebClip Assistant extension
2. Click settings icon or navigate to `chrome://extensions/ → Options`
3. In Notion Integration section:
   - Paste integration token
   - Enter database ID (from URL: `https://www.notion.so/workspace//database-id?v=...`)
4. Click "Test Connection" button
5. Verify success message appears

## Test Scenarios

### T001: Basic Save Functionality
**Objective**: Verify basic save to Notion works correctly

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to any web page
2. Click WebClip Assistant extension icon
3. Wait for page information to load
4. Click "Save to Notion" button
5. Observe progress indicator
6. Verify success message appears
7. Check Notion database for new entry

**Expected Results**:
- Loading spinner appears on "Save to Notion" button during operation
- Button is disabled during save to prevent duplicate submissions
- Success message appears in center of popup with page title format: "✓ Saved '[Page Title]' to Notion"
- Popup automatically closes after 1 second on successful save
- New page created in Notion with all mapped fields
- Title, URL, Description, Summary, Notes, Tags, and Created Date properly formatted

### T002: Configuration Validation
**Objective**: Test configuration validation and error handling

**Steps**:
1. Open extension settings
2. Enter invalid integration token
3. Click "Test Connection"
4. Observe error message
5. Enter valid token but invalid database ID
6. Click "Test Connection"
7. Observe error message
8. Enter correct configuration
9. Verify successful connection

**Expected Results**:
- Clear error messages for invalid token
- Clear error messages for invalid database
- Success message for valid configuration
- Helpful error resolution suggestions

### T003: Field Mapping Configuration
**Objective**: Test field mapping setup and validation

**Steps**:
1. In settings, locate field mapping section
2. Modify default field mappings
3. Test with different property names
4. Verify mapping validation works
5. Save configuration
6. Test save operation with new mappings

**Expected Results**:
- Field mapping UI is intuitive and responsive
- Validation prevents invalid property mappings
- Save operation respects new field mappings
- Configuration persists across extension reloads

### T004: Error Handling Scenarios
**Objective**: Test comprehensive error handling

**Steps**:
1. **Network Error**: Disconnect internet, attempt save
2. **Invalid Data**: Enter extremely long title, attempt save
3. **Permission Error**: Remove integration access, attempt save
4. **Rate Limit**: Rapid successive save attempts
5. **Missing Properties**: Try to save to database with missing required properties

**Expected Results**:
- Graceful error messages with actionable guidance
- Error states are properly reflected
- Retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Data validation prevents invalid saves

### T005: User Experience Validation
**Objective**: Validate overall user experience and feedback

**Steps**:
1. Test complete workflow from setup to save
2. Verify all progress indicators and loading states
3. Test button state management during save operations
4. Test centered success notifications with page titles
5. Verify auto-close functionality after successful save
6. Test dark/light theme compatibility
7. Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
8. Test keyboard navigation and accessibility

**Expected Results**:
- Smooth, intuitive user experience with minimal user interaction
- Clear visual feedback for all operations including loading states
- Button properly disabled during save to prevent duplicates
- Success notifications appear in center with specific page titles
- Popup automatically closes after successful Notion save
- Consistent design across themes
- Accessible interface for all users

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] FR-001: "Save to Notion" button works correctly
