# Feature Specification: Notion Integration

**Feature Branch**: `[001-save-to-notion]`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Save to notion.1.实现 "保存到 Notion" 按钮 2.创建设置页面配置 Notion,可以配置 Notion Integration Token，Database ID，字段映射设置:标题 → Notion.Name (Title)/URL → Notion.URL (URL)/标签 → Notion.Tags (Multi-select)/摘要 + 笔记 → Notion.Page Content 3.提供参考 notion 模板。"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: How should the Notion configuration settings be stored for persistence? → A: Chrome storage sync (for secure API key storage per constitutional requirements)
- Q: What should happen when the user's Notion database is missing required properties that are mapped in the configuration? → A: Show error message requiring user to manually add missing properties
- Q: How should the system handle data validation when captured content doesn't match Notion property constraints? → A: Show validation error and prevent saving until user fixes the data
- Q: What level of user feedback should be provided during the Notion save operation? → A: Progress indicator with detailed status updates
- Q: What type of reference Notion database template should be provided? → A: Step-by-step guide for users to create database manually

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to save web content directly to my Notion workspace so that I can organize and manage my research, bookmarks, and notes in one place without manual copy-pasting.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have captured web content in the extension, **When** I click the "Save to Notion" button, **Then** the content should be successfully saved to my configured Notion database with all mapped fields
2. **Given** I haven't configured Notion integration, **When** I click "Save to Notion", **Then** I should be prompted to configure my Notion settings
3. **Given** I am in the settings page, **When** I enter valid Notion credentials and test the connection, **Then** the system should confirm successful connection
4. **Given** I have configured field mappings, **When** I save content, **Then** each field should be saved to the correct Notion property according to the mapping

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Notion API is unavailable or returns an error?
- How does system handle invalid or expired Notion integration tokens?
- When the Notion database doesn't have expected properties, system MUST show error message requiring user to manually add missing properties
- How does system handle network connectivity issues during save operations?
- When a field contains data that doesn't match Notion property constraints, system MUST show validation error and prevent saving until user fixes the data

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a "Save to Notion" button in the main interface that allows users to send captured content to Notion
- **FR-002**: System MUST create a settings page where users can configure Notion integration parameters including Integration Token and Database ID
- **FR-003**: System MUST support field mapping configuration between extension fields and Notion database properties with the following default mappings:
  - Title → Notion.Name (Title property)
  - URL → Notion.URL (URL property)
  - Tags → Notion.Tags (Multi-select property)
  - Summary + Notes → Notion.Page Content (rich text content)
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate Notion credentials and connection before allowing users to save content
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback to users when Notion operations fail, including progress indicator with detailed status updates during save operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide users with a step-by-step guide for manually creating a Notion database that matches the expected field structure, including:
  - Instructions for creating Notion integration and obtaining API token
  - Database creation steps with specific property types (Title, URL, Multi-select, Rich Text)
  - Property naming conventions and field mapping explanations
  - Integration sharing and permission setup instructions
  - Troubleshooting common setup issues
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist user's Notion configuration settings using chrome.storage.sync for secure API key storage
- **FR-008**: System MUST meet performance targets of <2s API response time and <200ms UI response time for in-operation updates

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Notion Configuration**: Stores user's Notion integration settings including authentication token, database ID, and field mapping preferences
- **Content Data**: Represents the captured web content with fields for title, URL, tags, summary, and user notes that will be mapped to Notion properties
- **Notion Database Template**: Step-by-step guide for users to create database manually with expected field structure
