# Tasks: Notion Integration Enhancement

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-save-to-notion/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → ✅ Implementation plan found
   → Extract: Chrome extension, existing codebase enhancement
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract NotionConfiguration, FieldMapping entities
   → research.md: Extract enhancement decisions
   → quickstart.md: Extract test scenarios
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Analysis: Understand existing implementation
   → Enhancement: Field mapping, validation, UX improvements
   → Testing: Comprehensive Notion integration tests
   → Documentation: User guides and setup instructions
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Manual testing after implementation
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All functional requirements covered
   → All test scenarios included
   → All enhancement areas addressed
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 3.1: Analysis & Setup
- [x] T001 Analyze existing Notion integration implementation in current codebase
- [x] T002 [P] Identify gaps between current implementation and specification requirements
- [x] T003 [P] Document enhancement priorities based on research findings

## Phase 3.2: Enhanced Configuration Management
- [ ] T004 Enhance field mapping configuration UI in ui/settings.html
- [ ] T005 Implement field mapping configuration logic in ui/settings.js
- [ ] T006 Add field mapping validation against Notion database schema in ui/settings.js
- [ ] T007 Update configuration storage format to use chrome.storage.sync and include field mappings in background.js

## Phase 3.3: Enhanced Validation & Error Handling
- [ ] T008 [P] Implement comprehensive input validation for Notion operations in background.js
- [ ] T009 Add detailed error messages and user guidance for Notion failures in background.js
- [ ] T010 Implement property constraint validation before Notion API calls in background.js
- [ ] T011 Add retry mechanisms for transient API failures in background.js

## Phase 3.4: Enhanced User Experience
- [ ] T012 Add detailed progress indicators for Notion save operations in ui/popup.js
- [ ] T013 Implement status updates during Notion API operations in ui/popup.js
- [ ] T014 Enhance success/error feedback with actionable messages in ui/popup.js
- [ ] T015 Add loading states and disable controls during operations in ui/popup.js

## Phase 3.5: Enhanced Notion API Integration
- [ ] T016 Upgrade Notion API integration to support configurable field mappings in background.js
- [ ] T017 Implement dynamic property mapping based on user configuration in background.js
- [ ] T018 Add comprehensive API error handling and logging in background.js
- [ ] T019 Implement database schema validation and property type checking in background.js

## Phase 3.6: Manual Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] T020 [P] Manually test field mapping configuration with various database schemas
- [ ] T021 [P] Manually test error handling scenarios (network, auth, validation failures)
- [ ] T022 [P] Manually test user experience across different themes and screen sizes
- [ ] T023 [P] Manually validate performance meets requirements (<2s API response)

## Phase 3.7: Documentation & User Guidance
- [ ] T025 Create step-by-step Notion setup guide in docs/notion-setup-guide.md
- [ ] T026 Add field mapping configuration instructions to docs/notion-setup-guide.md
- [ ] T027 Create troubleshooting section for common Notion integration issues
- [ ] T028 Update README.md with enhanced Notion integration features

## Phase 3.8: Integration & Final Validation
- [ ] T029 Integrate all enhancements into existing codebase
- [ ] T030 Manually test end-to-end Notion integration workflow
- [ ] T031 Manually validate all functional requirements from specification
- [ ] T032 Manual performance testing and optimization

## Dependencies
- Analysis (T001-T003) before enhancement tasks (T004-T019)
- Configuration (T004-T007) before validation (T008-T011)
- Validation (T008-T011) before UX enhancements (T012-T015)
- UX enhancements (T012-T015) before API upgrades (T016-T019)
- All implementation before manual testing (T020-T023)
- Manual testing before documentation (T025-T028)
- Documentation before final integration (T029-T032)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T002-T003 together:
Task: "Identify gaps between current implementation and specification requirements"
Task: "Document enhancement priorities based on research findings"

# Launch T020-T023 together:
Task: "Manually test field mapping configuration with various database schemas"
Task: "Manually test error handling scenarios (network, auth, validation failures)"
Task: "Manually test user experience across different themes and screen sizes"
Task: "Manually validate performance meets requirements (<2s API response)"
```

## Critical Path
The most critical tasks that must be completed in sequence:
1. T001: Analysis of existing implementation
2. T004-T007: Enhanced field mapping configuration (core requirement)
3. T016-T019: Enhanced Notion API integration (core functionality)
4. T030-T031: Manual end-to-end validation (specification compliance)

## Success Criteria
Each task should be considered complete when:
- All functional requirements from specification are implemented
- Field mapping configuration works with various Notion database schemas
- Progress indicators provide detailed status updates during operations
- Error handling is comprehensive and user-friendly
- Documentation enables users to set up Notion integration independently
- Performance meets Chrome extension guidelines

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- This is an enhancement project, not new development
- Focus on bridging gaps between existing implementation and specification
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Follow Chrome extension security and performance best practices
- All configuration should be stored using chrome.storage.sync per constitutional requirements

## Task Generation Rules Applied

1. **From Data Model**:
   - NotionConfiguration entity → configuration tasks (T004-T007)
   - FieldMapping entity → field mapping tasks (T004-T007, T016-T019)
   - ValidationResult entity → validation tasks (T008-T011)

2. **From User Stories**:
   - Configuration story → settings enhancement tasks (T004-T007)
   - Save operation story → API enhancement tasks (T016-T019)
   - Error handling story → validation tasks (T008-T011)
   - Progress feedback story → UX enhancement tasks (T012-T015)

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Basic save functionality → manual testing tasks (T020-T023)
   - Configuration validation → validation tasks (T008-T011)
   - Error handling scenarios → error handling tasks (T008-T011)
   - User experience validation → UX tasks (T012-T015)
